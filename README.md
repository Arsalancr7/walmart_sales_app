# 🛍️ Walmart Store Sales Forecasting App

This project is a full-stack machine learning software application designed to forecast department-wise weekly sales for Walmart stores using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models and SQL for data storage and querying. Built with **Streamlit**, **TensorFlow**, and **SQLite**, the app allows users to upload raw data, preprocess it, train models, and visualize predictions—all through an interactive web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Upload raw CSV data (`train.csv`, `features.csv`, `stores.csv`)
- 🧠 Train an LSTM model per Store and Department
- 📊 Visualize predicted vs. actual sales
- 🗃️ Store and query data using SQLite via SQLAlchemy
